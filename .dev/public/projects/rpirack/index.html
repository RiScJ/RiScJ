			<p>Self-hosting is something that is important to me. You should self-host, too. It teaches you a lot. You'll learn about networking, maintaining large numbers of services, programming, and more. How deep you want to go with it is really up to you.</p>
			<p>The Pi server rack is something that in my opinion would make a good entry point for those who want to learn more about managing a system for themselves. It offers a taste of reality insofar as needing to administer and maintain documentation for multiple machines; but, it maintains simplicity for a beginner by not jumping immediately into software containerization, while doing essentially the same thing.</p>
			<p>You could use a system like this to teach yourself about cluster computingâ€”about how to run tasks in parallel across many machines. There are lots of reasons to build a setup like this, and it is really quite enjoyable. I recommend you try it yourself!</p>
