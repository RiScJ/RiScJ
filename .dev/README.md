Source for my personal website at riscj.dev.


I write pages in a pseudo-markdown format. A C++ program I wrote parses these files and outputs HTML. These outputs are the sources for the website seen in the public/ directory.

The parsing application is just a fun side project. If you're interested, you can see it at RiScJ/mummd.
